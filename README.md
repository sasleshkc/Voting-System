This is the prototype for the voting system used in a Science and IT Expo on 6Feb 2024.This project was built for voting locally.The names of the actual candidates alongside their stalls were later updated before the day of expo(i.e7thfeb).This was more of a fun project.I had forgot to push this project in github at that time due to the chaos but now I have all the time I need in the Universe(Until I'm ded ded,quite literally).
